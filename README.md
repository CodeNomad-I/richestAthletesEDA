# EDA report on the Forbes Richest Athletes 1990-2020 dataset
## Project description
Forbes, a well-known American magazine which raised the bar and prestige of The List, and walked so that WatchMojo could run.

On this occasion, I was interested in exploring a dataset that includes the Forbes richest athletes of the year, spanning from 1990 to 2020. 
Each ranking contained the athletes name, the sport they play, their nationality and their estimated net worth.
The dataset can be found on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parulpandey/forbes-highest-paid-athletes-19902019

**The aim of this project was to:**
* Spot the trends occuring in the world of sports, such as which sports produce the wealthiest athletes?
* See how the passage of time has affected each sport, has attention been lost, or is it starting to build momemntum?
* Which nationalities make the list the most, has the diversification on the list changed over time?
* Finally to display these findings (and many more) on an EDA document.

**In the Jupyter Notebook you will see:**
* How I approached the cleaning of this filthy dataset.
* Data Visualisations and the insights I gleaned from them.
